âœ¨ Hi, Iâ€™m Dixel, a French sys-admin student âœ¨ Some of those programs I post are protected by licences, also, thanks to not use them for bad things. Any helps or suggestions are welcome. :D

DISCLAIMER : By using my apps, you accept some legacy Terms :
- I am not in any way responsible for the use that you make of the applications that are available, use them wisely and at your own risk. No claim for damages (or otherwise) can be made to me.ðŸ‘€
- You must respect the licenses applied if there are. ðŸ“œ
- Be respectful to keep Github a family place. ðŸ˜ƒ
- Everything I'm developing is respectful of the RGPD (RÃ©glement GÃ©nÃ©ral sur la Protection des DonnÃ©es) , for websites you need to adapt them to the RGPD before using them (LEGAL OBLIGATION). You can read RGPD Terms here : https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reglement-europeen-protection-donnees ðŸ¤³
- Of course, you need to respect Terms of Github. You can read them here : https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy ðŸ’»
